# Documentation: Dynamic Web App - Bulb Switch

## Overview

This document provides a brief overview and documentation for the HTML and JavaScript used in a dynamic web application. The application features a bulb image that can be switched on and off using buttons.

### HTML Structure

The HTML structure consists of the following main elements:

1. `<center>`: Deprecated element used to center align content. It wraps the entire content of the page.
2. `<head>`: Contains metadata and references to external resources such as stylesheets and scripts.
3. `<body>`: Contains the main content of the page.
   - `.dark-background`: A class for styling the background of the page.
   - `.bulb-image`: Image element for displaying the bulb image.
   - `.cat-image`: Image element for displaying a cat image.
   - `.switch-board`: Container for the switch controls.
     - `.switch-status`: Header element to display the current switch status.
     - `.off-switch`: Button to turn the bulb off.
     - `.on-switch`: Button to turn the bulb on.

### External Resources

The HTML file references the following external resources:

- `background.css`: External CSS file for styling the background.
- `script.js`: External JavaScript file for implementing functionality.
- Bootstrap library: External library for additional JavaScript functionality and styling.

## JavaScript Functions

### `switchOn()`

This function is called when the "ON" button is clicked. It changes the source of the bulb image to a lit bulb image and updates the switch status text to "Switched On".

### `switchOff()`

This function is called when the "OFF" button is clicked. It changes the source of the bulb image to a turned off bulb image and updates the switch status text to "Switched Off".

### `DOMContentLoaded` Event Listener

This event listener ensures that the JavaScript code inside it executes only after the HTML content is fully loaded. It initializes the switch status to "Switched On" and sets up event listeners for the "ON" and "OFF" buttons.

## Conclusion

This documentation provides an overview of the HTML structure and JavaScript functionality used in the dynamic web application. Users can interact with the buttons to turn the bulb image on and off.
